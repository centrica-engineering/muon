      <p>Welcome to the Muon Cake Configurator â€“ a testing area for existing and potential Muon components in a hypothetical cake business.</p>
      <p>The purpose is to test Muon components in certain scenarios and as part of a user journey, to place them in context and understand how they perform, which in turn can inform how they are best built.</p>
