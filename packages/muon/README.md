# Muon

> ⚠️ Experimental. Use at your own risk. Things might change and break.

Muon is a versatile token based pattern library using webcomponents for Design Systems. It provides a foundation for building a Design System and a set of components to get you started. Unlike other pattern libraries we don't provide a set of styles, we provide a set of tokens that can be used to build your own styles.

This means you can quickly get your own branded components up and running without having to write any CSS or JavaScript.

## Design tokens and themes

Muon uses design tokens to provide a consistent look and feel across all components. Tokens are defined in a JSON file and can be used to build your own styles. Muon provides a default theme that can be used as a starting point for your own theme.
